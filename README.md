# VitalPath AI - Public Health Chatbot

VitalPath AI is an end-to-end, high-performance public health chatbot designed for symptom triage, health education, and emergency guidance.

## ✨ Features

- **Empathetic AI Assistant**: A conversational interface that guides users through health concerns.
- **Advanced Symptom Triage**: A logic-driven engine that matches user input against medical datasets to provide preliminary assessments.
- **Health Library**: Curated information on public health topics like immunization and disease prevention.
- **Emergency Protocols**: Quick access to critical help during medical emergencies.
- **Premium Design**: Built with a sleek, medical-grade UI using glassmorphism and modern CSS.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Variables & Flex/Grid), and ES6+ JavaScript.
- **Medical Logic**: The triage engine uses a weighted scoring system to match symptoms to potential conditions.
- **Scalability**: Designed to easily integrate with an LLM (e.g., Gemini API) for conversational depth or a robust backend (e.g., Spring Boot/Maven) for full EHR integration.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Interact with the 'Assistant' to start a conversation.
3. Use the 'Symptom Checker' for a guided triage assessment.

## 📂 Dataset Integration

This prototype is designed to work with large-scale medical datasets like the `Final_Augmented_dataset_Diseases_and_Symptoms.csv`. In a production environment, this CSV would be processed by a backend service (e.g., Python/FastAPI with Scikit-learn or Node.js) to provide high-fidelity diagnostic predictions.
